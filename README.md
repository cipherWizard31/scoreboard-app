# ⚽ Football Scoreboard – Next.js Mini Project

A lightweight football (soccer) scoreboard built with Next.js and React hooks.
When the app loads, users enter the names of two teams. Once the match starts, a timer begins counting, and the + / – buttons allow updating team scores — but only while the timer is running.

## 🧩 Features

Team name setup screen

Live match timer with start, pause, and reset controls

Dynamic score updates restricted to active playtime

Simple, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS

Clean component logic built entirely with React state and hooks

## 💡 Purpose

This project focuses on mastering React hooks, state management, and component structure in a real-world, time-based app — perfect for practicing clean state flow and conditional rendering in Next.js.
